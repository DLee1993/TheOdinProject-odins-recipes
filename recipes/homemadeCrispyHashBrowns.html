        <p>
            Good, old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns. Perfect with hot pepper sauce and
            ketchup!
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is
            sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole
            bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It
            should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it
            can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve
            immediately.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
